# ft_irc
An IRC server written from scratch in C++98.

The server handles multiple client connections and implements a subset of the IRC 2812 protocol, including user authentication, channels, private messaging, and basic command execution.

Good for learning sockets, poll/epoll, and protocol handling.

Not meant to be a full production IRC server.
